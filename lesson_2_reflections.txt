What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

	The automatic merging :
		pros: it saves a lot of time for people to copy and paste files and find differences between files.
		cons: if there are conflicts, automatic merging may cause bugs.
	always doing merges manually:
		pros: it will never have bugs since people are checking the files on their own and they know what they want to change as long as it is shown.
		cons: it is so fastidious to check the differences btween large files. And some times it is really hard for people to find the exact differences by eyes.
