When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	We want to use a remote repository whenever we want ot share our work or we are working with someone else, or we want to work on different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because if someone else make some changes that we did not want or we have not save our local file, we both do not want to update our local repository.
